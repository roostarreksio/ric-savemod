# ric-savemod
A mod for Rex and Wizards game that reorganizes save-state files.

---

### How to install:
* Download the latest release ZIP [here](https://github.com/roostarreksio/ric-savemod/releases/latest).
* Copy contents of the archive to your game's installation folder (e.g. *"C:/Program Files/AidemMedia/Reksio i Czarodzieje"*)
* Start the "*ric-savemod.bat*" file and continue with instructions on screen.

Before changing any files, the script crates backups of all the required files, and saves them with **.bak* extension. Those files can be restored using the second *(2)* option in the installer.

### ! Important:
If the game is installed in a folder on system drive, running the .bat file as **Administrator** is required! Otherwise the script can't modify any files.

---

After installation, savestate files will be saved in "Common\save" folder, and individual slots will be saved to matching folders. Also, all savestate files from the slots are now interchangable.

Note: This is still an ***experimental*** mod, which needs more testing to make sure it is stable.
